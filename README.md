Data structures:
    Hashtable for folders(sites) and AVL Trees for each folder's files.
    Each item uses lists for accessing its common items and specs.
    This hashtable/avl structure was used in last year's System Programming course and worked rather well.
    Many structures were already implemented by us during that course and modified for satisfying this project's requirements.

Notes:
    During this project a fully functional JSON file parser was implemented.
